# UX-Focused Testing Script for SoundPath

**Before you start:** Do the App-Wide Audit in [TESTING_SCRIPT.md](../TESTING_SCRIPT.md) (Part 1) first; then run this script with your tester. Focus on where they get stuck or ask for help—you can handle tech issues separately.

This script walks through every user-facing function using minimal task prompts and open UX questions, so you can see whether clients can use the app intuitively without a tutorial.

## 1. First-time experience

**Task**

- You're considering using this tool. Look at the landing page.
- When you're ready, sign up for an account and get to the first screen after signup.

**UX questions (pick 2–3)**

- Did the landing feel like a professional A&R/tool product?
- Was it clear what the product does and who it's for?
- After signup, did you know where you were (launchpad vs dashboard)?
- Was it obvious what to do next?

**Notes**

## 2. Launchpad and workspace model

**Task**

- You're on the launchpad. Find your personal inbox.
- Then find how to get into one of your labels (or create a label if the account has none).

**Success looks like:** They open Personal Dashboard and Enter a label (or create one) without guessing.

**UX questions (pick 2–3)**

- Was it clear that "Personal Dashboard" is your own inbox and labels are separate workspaces?
- Was "Enter" on a label card obvious?

## 3. Add submission (manual + link)

**Task**

- Add a demo to your personal inbox without using a link—add it manually.
- Then find the link you would send to an artist to submit to your personal inbox and copy it.

**UX questions (pick 2–3)**

## 4. Label context and submissions

**Success looks like:** They know they're in a label, add or submit to that label, and see the new submission in the right place.

## 5. Kanban and moving tracks

**Task**

- In your personal or label dashboard, find the pipeline (columns).

**UX questions (pick 2–3)**

- Was it obvious that you could drag (or use arrows) to move a track?

## 6. Phase detail view

**Task**

- Open one pipeline phase so you see a list of tracks in that phase.

**UX questions (pick 2–3)**

- Was it clear that clicking a phase/column opened this view?
- Did you understand this was still the same pipeline, just focused on one stage?

**Notes**

- On your phone, log in, go to the launchpad, then open your personal dashboard.
- Open the menu, switch to a label, then add a submission or view a track.

**Task**

- Imagine you closed the app yesterday after denying a track at a label. Today you want to find that track again. Do it.

## What to capture during the session

- **Where they hesitated or clicked the wrong thing** (without you guiding).
- **Quotes** for "Was it obvious…?" and "Where would you look…?".
- **Any step where they asked you for help** — that's a UX gap.
- **Time or number of clicks** for key tasks (optional): e.g. "Add a submission," "Copy submission link," "Find a denied track."
